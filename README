PGTop for Android is a PostgreSQL database statistics monitoring app.

This project was initially started using Eclipse 3.5.2 and r06 of the Android
SDK.  It was tested uses a PostgreSQL JDBC jar file posted to the PgAndroid
Google Group by Dave Cramer on June 9, 2010.

It was developed against PostgreSQL 8.4 and should work on the up coming 9.0
release.  It has been tested against 8.3 and 8.2 to some degree.

When building, the file '.classpath' needs to be modified to include the
PostgreSQL JDBC jar file that works on the Android platform.  When using
Eclipse, the jar can be added using the following directions:
