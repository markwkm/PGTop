PGTop for Android is a PostgreSQL database statistics monitoring app.

This project was initially started using Eclipse 3.5.2 and r06 of the Android
SDK.  It was developed against PostgreSQL 8.4 and should work on the up coming
9.0 release.  It has been tested against 8.3 and 8.2 to some degree.

When building, the file '.classpath' needs to be modified to include the
PostgreSQL JDBC jar file.  It needs to be newer than build 801 in order to work
on the Android platform.  Please note comments on the download page about
whether JDBC3 or JDBC4 should be used.  The jar file can be downloaded from:
