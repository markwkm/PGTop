This project was initially started using Eclipse 3.5.2 and r06 of the Android
SDK.  It was tested uses a PostgreSQL JDBC jar file posted to the PgAndroid
Google Group by David Cramer on June 9, 2010.

It was developed against PostgreSQL 8.4 and should work on the up coming 9.0
release.  This app will not work against version 8.2 or older until more care
is taken to compensate for tables and columns that do not exist prior to 8.4.

When building, the file '.classpath' needs to be modified to include the
PostgreSQL JDBC jar file that works on the Android platform.  When using
Eclipse, the jar can be added using the following directions:
